\section{Aim}
The aim of this thesis is to review the current literature on existing approaches to creating microfrontends, and analyze in depth and compare these approaches from the perspective of enterprise applications in aspects such as reusability, extensibility, resource sharing, and application state management. \\

\noindent
Subsequently, one of these prospective approaches will be selected to validate its suitability and correctness by implementing a simple prototype microfrontend application implemented in an enterprise technology such as Angular \cite{Angular} or React \cite{React}. Finally, conclusions will be drawn and the chosen approach will be evaluated.
