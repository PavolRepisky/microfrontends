\section{Application Introduction}
One of the requirements for the application was to focus on the enterprise landscape. The application should be logically divisible into independent business concerns, striking a balance between being overly simplistic—making a microfrontends architecture irrelevant—and overly complex, making development unfeasible within the boundaries of this thesis. A well-known example that meets these criteria is a project management tool. However, a standard project management tool is quite large and includes many features. Therefore, only its core functionality will be implemented, sufficient for a proof-of-concept (PoC) application. At its core, the main purpose is to manage project users and their tasks, which will be the primary focus. The application will offer functionality for creating and managing users, managing tasks, linking tasks to users, and presenting this information in a clear and comprehensible manner. These functionalities will be discussed in more detail in the next section.
