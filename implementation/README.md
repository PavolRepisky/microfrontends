# Implementation

As part of this thesis, a prototype project management application was developed using a microfrontend architecture. The application is built with Web Components and Angular.

The system is divided into two main parts: the backend and the frontend. The frontend itself is further decomposed into multiple microfrontends, each handling a specific feature or domain of the application.

To learn more about the application and how to run it, refer to the following directories:

- [`project-management-tool`](./project-management-tool): Contains the frontend codebase.
- [`project-management-api`](./project-management-api): Contains the backend API implementation.
