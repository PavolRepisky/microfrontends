\section{Scope and Limitations}
This study focuses on exploring the concept of microfrontends and their application in modern web development, particularly in the context of enterprise-level applications. The scope encompasses: analysis of microfrontend approaches, their comparison, prototype design and development, and assessment of one chosen approach. \\\\
While this study aims to provide insights into microfrontend architecture, certain limitations must be acknowledged. Due to the breadth of the topic, the thesis will not cover every prominent aspect of microfrontend architecture. Furthermore, it will not cover every existing approach to implementing microfrontends. Instead, it focuses on those most commonly referenced in literature and industry practices. Findings and conclusions drawn from the prototype development may not be universally applicable to all scenarios. The prototype development will be constrained by time and technological resources available, impacting the complexity and scale of the application. The resulting application primarily functions as a proof of concept rather than a fully deployable solution for real-world use.
