This chapter offers an insightful exploration of the design considerations essential for the resultant prototypical microfrontends application. It begins with a brief introduction, outlining the application's core purpose and objectives. Subsequently, it examines its functional and non-functional requirements. Following that, a dedicated section elaborates on how the the application will be split into micro-frontends and outlines the teams that will be established for this purpose. Subsequently, the system architecture is discussed, followed by a dedicated section on the technologies used for implementation. Finally, graphical user interface mockups are presented.
