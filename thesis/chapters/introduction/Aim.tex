\section{Aim}
The aim of this thesis is to review the current literature on existing approaches for creating microfrontends, and to analyze and compare these approaches from the perspective of enterprise applications in aspects such as reusability, extensibility and resource sharing.

Subsequently, one of these prospective approaches will be selected to validate its suitability and correctness by implementing a simple prototype microfrontend application in an enterprise technology such as Angular \cite{Angular} or React \cite{React}. Finally, conclusions will be drawn, and the chosen approach will be evaluated.
