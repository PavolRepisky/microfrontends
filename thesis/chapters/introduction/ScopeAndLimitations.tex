\section{Scope and Limitations}
Due to the breadth of the topic of microfrotends, the thesis will not cover all the important aspects of this architecture. Furthermore, it will not cover all possible existing approaches to implementing microfrontends, focusing on selecting those that are most commonly mentioned in the literature and used in practice. \\

\noindent
The resulting application will serve as a proof of the validity of the chosen approach, not as a fully deployable solution for real-world use. The development of the application will be limited by time and available resources, which will affect its complexity and scope. The findings and conclusions drawn may not be generally applicable to all scenarios.
