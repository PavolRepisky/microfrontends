\label{chap:Implementation}
In this chapter, we present the implementation of a prototypical project management application based on a microfrontends architecture using Web Components and Angular. We describe the development process in detail, highlighting the key implementation decisions, challenges encountered, and the solutions adopted to address them. The chapter is structured into several sections, covering an overall implementation overview, communication and composition, routing mechanisms, and application styling.
