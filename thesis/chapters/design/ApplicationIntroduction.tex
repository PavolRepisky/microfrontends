\section{Application Introduction}
One of the requirements for the application was to focus on the enterprise landscape. The application should be logically divisible into independent business concerns, striking a balance where it is not overly simplistic for a microfrontends architecture to lose its relevance, yet not overly complex to develop within the boundaries of the thesis. One of the well-known examples that combines these criteria is a project management tool. However, a standard project management tool is quite large, with many features. Therefore, we will implement only its core functionality, sufficient for a PoC application. At its very core, its main purpose is to manage project users and their tasks, which will be our main focus. It will offer functionality for creating and managing users, managing tasks, linking them to users, and presenting such information in an easily comprehensible manner. These functionalities will be discussed in more detail in the next section.
