# Diploma Thesis: Analysis, Design, and Implementation of Micro-frontend Architecture
## Comenius University Faculty of Mathematics, Physics, and Informatics

### Annotation
Micro-frontends represent the next evolutionary step in web-application architecture, introducing increased complexity to project development. Challenges such as routing, reusability, static asset serving, repository organization, etc., remain topics of active discussion within the community. While various approaches have been proposed, there is ongoing exploration for effective solutions to bootstrap projects and manage complexities.

### Goal
This thesis aims to comprehensively review existing literature on designing and developing web applications using micro-frontend architecture. Emphasis will be placed on comparing approaches in terms of reusability, extendibility, resource sharing, and application state management. The objective is to identify the most suitable approaches for enterprise application development. Subsequently, the thesis will involve designing and implementing a prototypical micro-frontend application based on the selected approach from the comparative analysis.
