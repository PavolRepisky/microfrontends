\section{Recommendations for Future Work}
Although this thesis covered many aspects and challenges of microfrontend architecture implemented via Web Components in Angular, there are still areas that were not addressed due to time limitations. We outline several of these areas for potential further research within this approach:
\begin{itemize} 
    \item Performance optimization techniques, such as lazy loading, code splitting, and resource sharing (primarily related to common dependencies). 
    \item State management for large-scale applications. 
    \item Integration testing solutions. 
    \item CI/CD pipeline strategies for independent microfrontend deployment. 
    \item Versioning and repository organization. 
\end{itemize}
Investigating these areas could help expand the adoption of microfrontend architecture in modern software development.
