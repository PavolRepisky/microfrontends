\section{Composition approaches}
There are several primary approaches to implementing a microfrontend application. Some are as straightforward as using a link, while others take a bit more time to understand. The most important thing to remember is that there isnâ€™t a single best solution for all projects. Each project needs to be thoroughly analyzed from different perspectives to choose the most suitable approach. This section presents five primary approaches, outlining their advantages, disadvantages, use cases, and an assessment of their characteristics to make the choice easier.
