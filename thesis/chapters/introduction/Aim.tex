\section{Aim}
This study aims to review the current literature on approaches for designing and developing web applications using microfrontend architecture. It seeks to conduct a comparative analysis of these approaches, focusing on their reusability, extendibility, resource sharing, and application state management. Special attention will be given to identifying approaches most suitable for enterprise-level application development. One such approach will be tested in a battle, by designing and developing a prototype microfrontend web application. Finally, conclusions will be drawn, and the selected approach will be evaluated based on the resulting application, providing a level of correctness and effectiveness of the chosen approach.
