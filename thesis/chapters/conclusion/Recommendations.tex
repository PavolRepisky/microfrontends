\section{Recommendations for Future Work}
Even though our thesis covered many aspects of microfrontend applications, there is still a lack of studies in this field. Below, we outline several areas for potential futher research.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Migration strategies from monolithic frontends to microfrontends.
    \item Applying microfrontend architecture to real-world applications.
    \item Performance optimization techniques for microfrontends, including lazy loading, code splitting, and resource sharing.
    \item Standardization efforts and best practices.
\end{itemize}
Investigating these topics could help to refine and expand the potential of microfrontend architecture in modern software development.
